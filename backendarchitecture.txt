This backend is a Node.js/Express.js application designed to manage a blood inventory system with authentication, admin functionalities, and analytics. Here's a detailed breakdown of each component:

1. server.js File
This is the entry point of your application. It:

Sets up a basic Express.js server.
Connects to the MongoDB database using connectDB().
Loads environment variables from the .env file, including sensitive configurations like PORT or database URLs.
Implements middlewares like express.json() for parsing JSON, cors() for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and morgan("dev") for logging HTTP requests.
Mounts different route modules to handle different parts of the application, including authentication, inventory management, and admin operations.
Starts the server on a specified port (e.g., 8080) and logs a message indicating the server is running.
2. Database Connection (config/db.js)
The connectDB() function in config/db.js handles the connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose. It ensures that the application is connected to the database for storing and retrieving data such as users, inventory, etc.

3. Route Files
Routes in Express.js define the endpoints for different functionalities:

testRoutes.js: Contains a basic test route to ensure the server is up and running.
authRoutes.js: Manages user registration, login, and fetching the current logged-in user. It interacts with the authentication logic in the authController.js.
inventoryRoutes.js: Handles CRUD operations related to the blood inventory system, allowing users to create, fetch, and manage blood records.
analyticsRoutes.js: Provides analytics on blood group data, used for reporting purposes.
adminRoutes.js: Allows admin users to manage donors, hospitals, and organisations. It also enables admins to delete specific records.
4. Middleware
Middleware in this project is used to handle certain processes before requests are passed on to the controllers:

authMiddleware.js: This ensures that the user is authenticated (logged in) before they can access certain routes.
adminMiddleware.js: This middleware ensures that only admin users can access certain sensitive routes like deleting a donor or managing organisations.
5. Controllers
Controllers contain the logic that runs when specific routes are accessed:

authController.js: Handles authentication tasks like user registration, login, and retrieving current user details.
inventoryController.js: Manages the blood inventory operations, including creating and fetching inventory records.
adminController.js: Contains the logic for admin operations such as fetching lists of donors, hospitals, and organisations, as well as deleting donor records.
analyticsController.js: Provides data and statistics on blood groups, enabling a more analytic view of the blood supply.
6. Models
Models define the data structure and schema for different collections in MongoDB:

userModel.js: Defines the schema for users, including attributes like role, name, email, password, and phone.
inventoryModel.js: Defines the schema for blood inventory records, including inventory type (in/out), blood group, quantity, and associated organisation or donor.
7. Environment Variables
The .env file stores configuration values that are environment-specific, such as:

PORT: Defines the port on which the server runs.
MONGO_URI: The connection string for the MongoDB database.
DEV_MODE: Indicates the environment (development, production) in which the application is running.
8. Key Dependencies
Express.js: A web framework for handling HTTP requests and building APIs.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB, simplifying data querying and validation.
dotenv: A library for loading environment variables from a .env file.
morgan: A middleware for logging HTTP requests in a standardized format.
cors: Enables your server to accept requests from different origins, especially useful for frontend-backend communication.
colors: Used to colorize console output for better visibility.
9. Authentication Flow
authRoutes.js allows users to register (/register) and log in (/login). Once logged in, the authMiddleware ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes.
The login system typically uses a token-based system (likely JWT, though not mentioned here), where the user receives a token upon login, and this token is used for subsequent API requests to verify their identity.
How Requests Flow Through the Backend
Client sends an HTTP request (e.g., creating a new blood inventory record).
Express routes the request to the appropriate route handler based on the URL and HTTP method (e.g., POST /api/v1/inventory/create-inventory).
Middleware executes:
If authentication is required, authMiddleware checks if the user is logged in.
If admin privileges are required, adminMiddleware verifies the userâ€™s role.
Controller function runs: The corresponding controller processes the request, interacts with the database if needed, and sends a response back to the client.
Response sent back to the client.
This backend structure is highly modular, cleanly separating concerns (routes, controllers, middlewares, models), making it scalable and easier to maintain.
